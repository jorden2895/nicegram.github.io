# Open-Source Enhanced Telegram Client for Web3

Nicegram is more than a messaging app — it’s a powerful open-source client built on top of Telegram, designed to bring Web3 functionality directly into everyday communication. While it keeps Telegram’s familiar interface and user experience, Nicegram adds a new layer of tools and integrations that help users manage digital identity, crypto assets, and AI assistants seamlessly within chat environments.

At its core, Nicegram enhances how users connect, transact, and interact online by merging messaging, wallet management, and AI into one secure and intuitive platform. Whether you’re sending messages, trading tokens, or following your favorite traders, everything happens without leaving the app.

Unlike traditional closed-source messengers, Nicegram operates transparently. It’s open-source, allowing developers to audit and contribute to its evolution. This approach builds trust, ensures privacy, and encourages a community-driven roadmap.

The result is a secure, privacy-respecting super app for the Web3 generation — one that combines communication, finance, and AI without compromising usability or freedom.
