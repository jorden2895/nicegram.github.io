# 🔥 Web3 Wallet

The Nicegram Web3 Wallet is designed to provide users with a seamless, secure, and efficient way to manage their digital assets. Here are the key features and functionalities of the Nicegram Wallet:

### **Non-Custodial Framework 🔐**

The Nicegram Wallet operates on a non-custodial framework, ensuring that users have full control over their private keys and funds. This guarantees that users' assets are secure and that they retain complete ownership and control over their digital assets. Unlike custodial wallets, where a third party holds the private keys, Nicegram ensures that only the user has access to their funds.

#### **Account Abstraction 🔑**

One of the standout features of the Nicegram Wallet is its account abstraction mechanism. Traditional wallets require users to remember a 12-word seed phrase to restore access. Nicegram simplifies this process by allowing users to set up a password for wallet recovery. The wallet uses a three-part token system:

1. **Your Device**: A unique identifier linked to your device.
2. **Your Nicegram Profile**: Your Nicegram account information.
3. **Your Password**: A password set by the user.

To restore access to the wallet, users need to have access to any two of these three components. This innovative approach eliminates the need to remember complex seed phrases while maintaining high security.

#### **Multichain Support 🌐**

The Nicegram Wallet supports multiple blockchain networks, allowing users to manage a diverse range of digital assets. This multichain capability ensures that users can interact with various blockchain ecosystems without needing multiple wallets. Whether it's Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or other popular blockchains, Nicegram provides seamless integration and management.

#### **In-Chat Payments 💬**

The Nicegram Wallet integrates seamlessly with the Nicegram messaging platform, enabling in-chat payments. Users can send and receive cryptocurrencies directly through chat, making transactions as easy as sending a message. This feature is facilitated by AI agents that automate repetitive tasks such as confirming transactions and providing real-time updates on payment status.

#### **AI Agent Integration 🤖**

Nicegram leverages AI agents to bridge the gap between Web2 users and the Web3 wallet. These AI agents provide a user-friendly interface and assist users in navigating the complexities of blockchain technology. Key functionalities include:

* **Guided Onboarding**: AI agents help new users set up their wallets and understand basic functionalities.
* **Transaction Assistance**: AI agents provide real-time support for transactions, ensuring that users can send and receive funds without errors.
* **Personalized Financial Advice**: AI agents analyze user behavior and market trends to offer tailored investment advice and insights.

#### **Enhanced Security Features 🛡️**

* **Multi-Signature Wallets**: Provides additional security by requiring multiple signatures for transaction approvals.
* **Custom Transaction Rules**: Users can set custom transaction rules to manage how and when transactions are processed.
* **Advanced Encryption**: Employs state-of-the-art encryption techniques to safeguard user data and transactions.
* **Regular Security Audits**: Conducts regular security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

#### **Developer-Friendly Tools 👨‍💻**
