# Referral System



Nicegram’s referral program allows users to earn from both direct and indirect invitations.\
There are **two referral levels**:

1. **Level 1 Referrals:** Direct invites — users you personally bring to Nicegram.
2. **Level 2 Referrals:** Indirect invites — users referred by your direct referrals.

Earnings from referrals are automatically credited in Gems.\
Premium users benefit from **double referral rewards**, increasing their potential income from network activity.
