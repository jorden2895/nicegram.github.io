# Spending Gems

Gems can be spent to unlock or enhance in-app features.\
They are used for access to **premium functionalities**, **AI assistant tools**, **customization options**, and **special content** inside Nicegram.\
This makes Gems an integral part of how users interact with both the communication and earning sides of the platform.
