# Earning Gems

**Gems** are Nicegram’s built-in virtual currency used across the ecosystem.\
Users can earn Gems by completing in-app activities such as:

1. Participating in **Nicegram Profit** monthly challenges.
2. Completing **daily tasks** within the app.
3. Inviting new users through the **referral system**.

Each activity contributes to the user’s total balance, which is tracked in the profile and Profit sections.
