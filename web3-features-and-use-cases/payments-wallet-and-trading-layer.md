# Payments, Wallet, and Trading Layer

Nicegram extends beyond chat and messaging — it builds a **complete transactional layer** within the communication environment.\
Every user, community, or creator can manage digital assets, send or receive payments, and interact with financial tools directly inside the app, without external wallets or exchanges.

This integration turns Nicegram into a **social financial hub** — where communication and value exchange coexist seamlessly.
