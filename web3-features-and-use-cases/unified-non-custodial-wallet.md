# Unified Non-Custodial Wallet

At the heart of Nicegram lies a **fully non-custodial wallet** that gives users complete control of their assets.\
Private keys never leave the device, and funds remain entirely on-chain. No intermediaries, no hidden custody — users own what they hold.

The wallet supports **multi-chain functionality**, allowing users to manage tokens, NFTs, and assets across various blockchains directly within their chats.\
This setup transforms messaging into a true financial layer — where users can send, receive, and track assets as naturally as sending a message.

It’s not just secure — it’s **intuitive and familiar**, bridging the gap between crypto-native tools and mainstream usability.
