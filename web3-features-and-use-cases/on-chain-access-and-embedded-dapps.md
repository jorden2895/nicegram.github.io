# On-Chain Access and Embedded dApps

Nicegram integrates **direct access to dApps** within the messenger interface, allowing users to explore Web3 utilities — such as DeFi tools, games, or marketplaces — without leaving their chats.

Users can:

* Swap tokens or view portfolio stats in real time.
* Interact with smart contracts directly through chat.
* Join decentralized communities that reward participation.

This creates a seamless experience where communication, decision-making, and on-chain execution happen in one place.
