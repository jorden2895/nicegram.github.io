# Privacy and Double Bottom Mode

Nicegram extends privacy far beyond message encryption.\
The **Double Bottom mode** allows users to hide sensitive chats or accounts behind an additional security layer â€” accessible only through secondary authentication.

This protects private communication, personal finance activity, or community management from unwanted exposure.\
Combined with its non-custodial design and open-source code, Nicegram ensures a level of privacy that centralized messengers cannot achieve.
