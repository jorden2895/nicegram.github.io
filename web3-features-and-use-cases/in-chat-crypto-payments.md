# In-Chat Crypto Payments

Nicegram redefines peer-to-peer transactions by embedding **crypto payments directly into chat**.\
Users can send or request funds during conversations, manage escrow-based transfers, or pay for digital services instantly — all without external wallets or third-party apps.

This feature supports both personal use and community applications, such as membership payments, tipping, or participation in tokenized activities.\
Every transaction remains secure, transparent, and verifiable on-chain — aligning financial interaction with the social flow of communication.
