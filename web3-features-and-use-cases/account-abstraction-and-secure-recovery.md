# Account Abstraction and Secure Recovery

To make self-custody accessible to everyone, Nicegram uses **account abstraction** with a **2-of-3 recovery model**.\
This system replaces traditional seed phrases with smart, user-friendly recovery methods combining device access, cloud backup, and a trusted component.

If a user loses a device, recovery is simple and secure — without exposing private keys or relying on centralized storage.\
This eliminates one of crypto’s biggest adoption barriers: the fear of losing funds due to forgotten seed phrases.

With account abstraction, Web3 becomes invisible to the end user — offering the convenience of Web2 and the ownership of Web3.
