# Profiles, Traders, and Multi-Account Flexibility

Nicegram users can manage **unlimited profiles** and customize each according to their purpose — personal, professional, trading, or community-based.

Traders can follow signal providers, track favorite KOLs, or build communities around their strategies — all within Nicegram’s familiar environment.\
Creators and community owners can link wallets, showcase referral stats, and directly interact with audiences.

Profiles become the **identity hub** of Nicegram — connecting communication, earnings, and activity across the ecosystem.
