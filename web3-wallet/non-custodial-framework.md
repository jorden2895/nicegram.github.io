# Non-Custodial Framework

Nicegram integrates a fully non-custodial wallet system, meaning users retain complete control over their private keys and funds. There are no intermediaries — assets stay on-chain and accessible only to the wallet owner.

This model aligns with Nicegram’s core philosophy of privacy and independence. By combining a familiar Telegram-style interface with Web3 infrastructure, users can manage crypto directly inside the app — send, receive, and track assets without ever exposing their keys or leaving the chat environment.

The non-custodial setup also supports secure backup and recovery features that preserve access even in case of device loss, ensuring both convenience and safety.
