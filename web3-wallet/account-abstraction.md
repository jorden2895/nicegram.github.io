# Account Abstraction

To simplify onboarding, Nicegram’s wallet uses **account abstraction**, allowing users to interact with Web3 without seed phrases or complex setups.&#x20;

Instead of manually storing keys, users can rely on a **2-of-3 recovery model** — typically combining device access, cloud backup, and a trusted contact or key component to restore their wallet securely.

This structure eliminates one of the biggest barriers in crypto adoption: the fear of losing access due to misplaced seed phrases. Users enjoy smooth login and recovery processes while maintaining full self-custody, aligning with Nicegram’s privacy-first principles.
