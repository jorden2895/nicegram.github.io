# Wallet-to-Earn

Nicegram rewards users for maintaining balances in their Nicegram Wallet.\
The longer and higher your balance, the more points you earn.

#### **Base Rewards**

| Deposit Amount | Points Earned |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| $15            | X points      |
| $100           | XX points     |
| $1,000         | XXX points    |
| $10,000        | XXX points    |

#### **Dynamic Multiplier Formula**

Additional points are calculated based on your balance, duration, and activity:

> **Points = Deposit Amount × Days Held × Multiplier**

* **Deposit Amount** — average wallet balance in USD
* **Days Held** — number of days balance was maintained
* **Multiplier** — reward coefficient determined by engagement level and overall pool performance

Rewards are distributed **periodically** through **snapshot-based airdrops**, ensuring fair and verifiable distribution.

#### **Example**

If you hold **$X** in your Nicegram Wallet for **30 days** with a **Xx multiplier**:\
→ **X × 30 × X = X points**

These points will appear in your **Profit Dashboard**, where they contribute to your overall Nicegram earning tier.



* Combine **Scroll-to-Earn** and **Wallet-to-Earn** for maximum rewards.
* Referral bonuses also apply to wallet activity — if your invitees hold balances, you benefit too.
