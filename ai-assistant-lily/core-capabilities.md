# Core Capabilities

Lily’s functionality spans across productivity, creativity, and communication.\
She supports both casual users and power users through:

* **Instant Answers** – Ask Lily anything: from general questions to summaries and insights.
* **Smart Message Assistance** – Generate, rewrite, or translate messages seamlessly in chat.
* **Content Creation** – Create captions, visuals, or community posts using GPT-4 and DALL·E 3 integrations.
* **Automation** – Manage group moderation, scheduling, or reminders directly through chat commands.
* **Discovery** – Help users find channels, bots, or communities that match their interests.

With ongoing upgrades, Lily will evolve into an AI layer deeply embedded in the Nicegram ecosystem — capable of supporting crypto tasks, content discovery, and personalized recommendations.
