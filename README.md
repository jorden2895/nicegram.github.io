#### What is Nicegram

Nicegram is a Web3-native messenger that merges communication, finance, and digital ownership into one seamless ecosystem.\
Built on the trusted foundation of Telegram’s infrastructure, it extends familiar messaging into the world of decentralized tools — offering users a unified environment for chatting, trading, earning, and managing assets.

By combining social interaction with wallets, payments, and AI utilities, Nicegram transforms how users experience messaging. It’s not just a place to talk — it’s a platform to transact, participate, and grow inside a secure and private interface.
