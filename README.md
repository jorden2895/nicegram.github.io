# Mission

Nicegram’s mission is to give users control — over their data, digital assets, and communication. The platform stands on three foundational principles:

1. **Open-Source Freedom** — The app’s source code is publicly available, allowing anyone to review or contribute. This openness ensures transparency, fosters innovation, and makes Nicegram adaptable to user needs.
2. **Community Ownership** — Nicegram grows with its users. From feature requests to ambassador initiatives and earning programs, the ecosystem rewards participation and feedback, reinforcing a shared sense of ownership.
3. **Privacy First** — Unlike centralized platforms that monetize user data, Nicegram prioritizes privacy and security. Users maintain full control over their accounts, private keys, and communication without third-party interference.

Together, these pillars make Nicegram a messenger built not just for Web3 users — but by them. It’s an evolving ecosystem that turns everyday communication into a gateway to decentralized finance, AI assistance, and secure self-sovereign interaction.
