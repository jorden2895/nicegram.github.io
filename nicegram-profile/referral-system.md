# Referral System

The referral system is built directly into Nicegram.

\
Each user has a personal referral link that allows them to invite others and earn rewards.\
Referrals are tied to profile activity and the Nicegram Profit system, where users can see how many people they’ve referred and what bonuses they’ve earned.

Premium users receive **double referral rewards**, making referrals one of the core engagement and earning features in the Nicegram ecosystem.
