# Nicegram Profit and Rewards

User profiles are connected to **Nicegram Profit**, the built-in earning layer of the app.\
Through the profile interface, users can track their **tasks, rewards, and referral performance**.\
This integration makes it easier to monitor progress in ongoing challenges and see accumulated Gems or prizes in real time.

Profiles therefore act as a hub for both personal data and activity within the Nicegram ecosystem â€” combining communication, earning, and engagement in one place.
