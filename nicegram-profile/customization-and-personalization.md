# Customization and Personalization

Nicegram allows users to personalize their experience within the app.\
Profiles can be customized to reflect individual preferences — from interface organization to how chats, folders, and message categories are displayed.\
Users can manage unlimited folders and use advanced filtering options to keep their work, trading, and community interactions organized.

Customization also includes profile-related settings that enhance usability and align with Nicegram’s goal of offering a more flexible, personal Telegram experience for Web3 users.
