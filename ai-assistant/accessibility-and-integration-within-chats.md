# Accessibility and Integration Within Chats

Lily is embedded throughout the Nicegram experience — no separate app, no complex setup. Users can access AI features directly in personal or group chats via the input bar, quick commands, or context menus.

This means users can:

1. Ask Lily to summarize long messages or channels.
2. Translate or rewrite text with a single command.
3. Generate content or visuals using GPT-4 and DALL·E 3.
4. Use AI as a personal assistant for note-taking, research, or brainstorming.

Lily’s integration ensures accessibility for everyone — beginners and advanced users alike — while maintaining a private, on-device experience aligned with Nicegram’s commitment to security and transparency.
