# AI Assistance

Nicegram includes a built-in AI assistant called **Lily**, powered by GPT-4. Lily is accessible directly within chats and helps users handle everyday tasks — from writing and summarizing messages to generating images or researching information.

Users can type naturally within any conversation and let Lily assist instantly, whether it’s drafting a reply, explaining a crypto term, or creating visuals using integrated AI tools like **DALL·E 3**.\
This tight integration of language and image generation turns Nicegram into a communication-plus-productivity hub — without leaving Telegram’s familiar interface.

Lily isn’t just a chatbot; she enhances message creation, supports real-time information retrieval, and helps manage workflow directly inside the app.\
By combining GPT-4 with Nicegram’s intuitive UI, Lily transforms chats into interactive spaces where communication and creativity coexist seamlessly.
