# Earn: Scroll-to-Earn

#### Overview

Nicegram introduces **Scroll-to-Earn**, a first-of-its-kind model that rewards users for doing what they already love — exploring channels, discovering content, and interacting with communities.\
It turns everyday activity inside the app into a measurable and transparent reward system tied directly to **Gems** and the upcoming **Profit** program.

This feature aligns with Nicegram’s core philosophy: users are the value creators of digital ecosystems, and they should share in the benefits of their participation.

#### How It Works

Scroll-to-Earn operates through an **activity-driven reward loop**:

* Users browse and engage with channels, posts, and discussions.
* The app measures active scrolling, reading time, and engagement depth.
* Verified, non-bot activity earns **Gems** — the more genuine engagement, the higher the reward.

This mechanism transforms time and curiosity into value.\
The more users explore and interact, the more they earn — all without changing their natural browsing habits.

#### Fair and Transparent Mechanics

To maintain fairness and prevent manipulation, the Scroll-to-Earn algorithm uses behavior validation and anti-spam logic to identify real activity.\
Only meaningful engagement — not idle scrolling — contributes to rewards.

Rewards are dynamically adjusted based on:

* Session duration and reading depth.
* Engagement quality (likes, shares, comments).
* Daily activity streaks.

Each user can view their performance and estimated rewards in the **Profit** dashboard, ensuring clarity and motivation through visible progress.

#### Synergy with Gems and Referrals

Scroll-to-Earn is closely tied to the **Gems** economy.\
Every scroll-based reward is issued in Gems, which can later be used for in-app benefits, AI tools, or Profit participation.

It also enhances the **referral system** — invited users who actively scroll and engage generate secondary rewards for their referrers, strengthening the network effect.

#### Why It Matters

Traditional social apps monetize attention — Nicegram rewards it.\
By giving users a share of the value they create, Scroll-to-Earn redefines engagement in the Web3 era: fair, rewarding, and community-powered.

This model sets the foundation for Nicegram’s broader earning ecosystem, bridging user participation with transparent, tokenized incentives.
