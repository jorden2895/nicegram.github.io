# How does data flow when I use Nicegram?

Different Nicegram actions use different systems. The safest useful explanation is
to identify the feature path, not to make one blanket privacy claim.

| Action | Main data path |
|---|---|
| Telegram chats, channels, account login, and ordinary calls | Telegram services and the client on your device |
| Hidden-chat state, preferences, cache, downloads, and some quick replies | Primarily the local app/device, with implementation differences |
| Nicegram account services, subscriptions, referrals, remote configuration, and feature eligibility | Nicegram services and relevant store/provider |
| AI prompts, selected chat context, translation, or transcription | Nicegram and/or the selected processing provider, depending on the feature |
| Wallet and dApp actions | Device/app wallet components, Nicegram services where required, and blockchain/dApp providers |
| Analytics, diagnostics, attribution, and website cookies | Nicegram and the providers disclosed by the current policy or store |

Nicegram’s current policy describes collection and processing needed for services,
usage analysis, device information, contacts or location when the relevant
permission or Telegram feature is used, and information you choose to provide. The
Apple and Google store disclosures should also be reviewed before installation.

The retired claim “we do not collect any personal data” is not used in this Help
Center because it is incompatible with those disclosures.

## Safer use

- Review operating-system permissions and disable ones you do not use.
- Check the context selected before sending an AI request.
- Keep login codes, two-step passwords, exported sessions, and wallet recovery
  material out of chats and support tickets.
- Remember that hiding a chat changes the local interface; it does not remove the
  conversation from another signed-in device.
- Read the current policy for legal definitions, retention, processors, and rights.
