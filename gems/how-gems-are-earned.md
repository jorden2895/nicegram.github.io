# How Gems Are Earned

Gems can be accumulated through multiple in-app activities, encouraging consistent participation and engagement:

* Completing **daily missions** and tasks within the app.
* Participating in **monthly Profit challenges**.
* Inviting new users through the **referral system**.
* Engaging with communities, content, and Nicegram features.

Each activity adds to the user’s Gem balance, which can be tracked directly through the **Profile** and **Profit** sections.\
Active users who contribute more — through engagement or referrals — are rewarded proportionally.

This structure transforms Nicegram into a **participation-based economy**, where value circulates among the community instead of external platforms.
