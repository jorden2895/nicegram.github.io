# Referral System

#### Overview

The **Nicegram Referral System** empowers every user to become a growth partner of the ecosystem.\
By inviting friends and communities to join, users unlock additional earning potential through layered rewards tied to **Gems** and **Scroll-to-Earn** activity.

This structure transforms Nicegram’s user base into a self-sustaining network, where community expansion directly benefits those who contribute to it.

#### How It Works

Each user receives a **unique referral link** that tracks new sign-ups and engagement.\
When an invited user joins Nicegram and starts participating — scrolling, chatting, or completing daily missions — the referrer automatically earns a share of the rewards.

Referrals are tracked transparently in the **Profit** section, allowing users to monitor:

* Number of active referrals.
* Cumulative Gems earned from referred users.
* Engagement levels and leaderboard ranking.

This ensures full visibility and builds trust in the reward process.

#### Reward Tiers

Nicegram’s referral system is designed with scalable incentives that encourage both depth and breadth of community growth:

* **Direct Rewards** – Earn a fixed percentage of Gems each time a referred user earns through Scroll-to-Earn or missions.
* **Bonus Multipliers** – Unlock higher rates by maintaining active streaks or reaching specific milestones.
* **Leaderboards and Challenges** – Compete globally or within regions for additional bonuses, seasonal drops, or limited-edition rewards.

This gamified approach motivates sustained participation and fair competition across the community.

#### Integration with Gems and Scroll-to-Earn

Referrals are seamlessly integrated into the **Gems** and **Scroll-to-Earn** systems, creating a continuous feedback loop:

* Referrers benefit when their invitees stay active.
* Invitees earn Gems and boost their own Profit potential.
* The ecosystem grows organically as users are incentivized to bring in engaged, real participants.

Through this mechanism, Nicegram evolves beyond a messaging app — it becomes a living, expanding ecosystem built by its users.



Referral-based growth is one of the most efficient and transparent methods of scaling Web3 ecosystems.\
Nicegram’s model ensures that rewards flow to those who actively help expand and sustain the community — not external advertisers or intermediaries.
